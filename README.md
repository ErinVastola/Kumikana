Kumikana is a syllable-based Japanese dictionary that allows users to easily compare Japanese words that differ by only a few syllables. Users can also see which combinations of syllables produce a real Japanese word. 

The name Kumikana comes from "組み合わせ (くみあわせ)," meaning "combination," and かな. 

The application consists of six scrollable columns, each of which contains a full list of hiragana syllables, including those with dakuten, handakuten, yōon, and sokuon, and a display area where definitions are displayed. 

The sequence of kana at the top of each column is matched to definitions from JMDict, including kanji and kana readings.

Users can search for words by scrolling through the columns until the desired kana is at the top. The blank spaces at the top can be used to form words that are shorter than six syllables long. 

For example, the word "日本語" would be formed by scrolling to "に", "ほ", "ん", "ご". Note that this sequence of four kana in any four columns will match with "日本語", provided that the other columns are blank. 

Kumikana does not currently support katakana spellings, or words and phrases longer than six syllables.
